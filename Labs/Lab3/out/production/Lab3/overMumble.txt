Please explain in 1-2 sentences the difference between Overriding and Overloading in Java.

When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters, it’s called Overloading.
When the method signature (name and parameters) are the same in the superclass and the child class, it’s called Overriding.
Overriding implements Runtime Polymorphism whereas Overloading implements Compile time polymorphism.
Overriding occurs between superclass and subclass. Overloading occurs between the methods in the same class.
